# Introduction

Pycon 2024 took place May 15-23 in Pittsburgh, PA. I went to the Saturday and Sunday days May 18-19\. There were many tracks and open spaces happening simultaneously. Open spaces were round tables like birds of a feather where people discussed arbitrary topics. There was even a track in Spanish. I went to mostly lectures on Saturday. Then, I went to mostly open sessions on Sunday.

# Memorable Lectures

## Sim Willison Keynote

This talk was mostly about large language models (LLMs). He went a little into copyright issues in the training data. Specifically, he mentioned that Meta's LLaMa model had some copyright issues. 4.5% of LLaMa's training dataset Sampling was books according to [LLaMa: Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.13971). An author, Sarah Silverman, has [sued](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788741/sarah-silverman-openai-meta-chatgpt-llama-copyright-infringement-chatbots-artificial-intelligence-ai) Meta and OpenAI for that. It wasn't mentioned in the talk, but there was a similar case with the [New York Times sueing OpenAI and Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/27/business/media/new-york-times-open-ai-microsoft-lawsuit.html). OpenAI's CTO, Mira Murati, mentioned that they use ["publicly available videos"](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1bfa7s3/openai_cto_mira_murati_confirms_that_the_video/). But it is against [YouTube's policy to train on their videos](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-04/youtube-says-openai-training-sora-with-its-videos-would-break-the-rules).

Another thing that he mentioned is that LLMs don't have a great way to objectively evaluate them. He says that the best way is to qualitatively compare them. He jokingly calls it vibes. There's a tool called [lmsys](https://chat.lmsys.org/) that does a side-by-side comparison of two different models with the same prompt.

## Jacob Lapenna: Open Source Industrial Control: Turning 2,800 Tons of Metal with Python and Flask

This talk covered some work managing a large piece of power generating infrastructure. The speaker is an electrical engineer. His project improved the workflow of maintaining what is a giant DC motor. Overall, it was very interesting to see someone putting together mechanical, electrical, and software skills.

# Notes from Open Sessions

## Dev Ex

There was talk about shadow ops - developers building their own infrastructure with little involvement of IT. Someone mentioned using [localstack](https://www.localstack.cloud/) to improve AWS testing.

## Ricing

Some folks showed off their desktop environment and their tools. There were a lot of vim enthusiasts. One member mentioned using a tool called [btop](https://github.com/aristocratos/btop). Someone showed off a song with [bespoke synth](https://www.bespokesynth.com/).
